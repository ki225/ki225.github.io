Lately, I've been enjoying spending time working in cozy cafés. There's just something about the aroma of coffee, the soft background music, and the gentle hum of conversations that makes it the perfect spot to focus. Below is a map of all the cafés I've visited so far—I'll be updating it as I explore more! ☕✨
